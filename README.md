# Where was I?
Where Was I is an application that stores your pinned locations. Useful if you want to remember where did you go before!

## How to use it? (in a nutshell)
1. Open the application.
2. Click the button `Add...`.
3. Type your location that you did go to.
4. Click OK, then BAM! You are done! It has an auto-update so no worries.

## What does it do?
It does the following:

* Creates a new file `pins.txt`.
* After you add or remove something, it updates the file.
* If you try to learn anything about the location you selected, it will make a google maps search. *This will of course require chrome, but maybe it will get changed in future.*
