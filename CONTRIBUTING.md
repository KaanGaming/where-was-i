# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES

There are the contributing guidelines. Also, not only that. Read [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/KaanGaming/where-was-i/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) too!

## Issues

Do you need to open an issue? You can! But in a proper way. Here's how to do it:

1. Make sure you have a good grammar, we need it to understand.
2. Put some informations, such as: What happened, What did you expect, How do you reproduce the result, Screenshots (if possible), Error log (if possible), and lastly Additional informations (if exists). This will help us to solve the problem.
3. To confirm it, you should read it again. Pretend you are reading this first time; *does it make sense?*

## Pull requests

Do you have anything that you want to pull it? Here, you are able to do it. But, in a proper way. There are the guidelines:

1. Once again, make sure you have a good grammar, we need it.
2. Put the reason, why do you want to do it. How much this request will change.
3. No minor changes unless it's a bugfix.
4. Same rule applies to the [last rule for issues](#Issues).

***

We expect:

1. No spam.
2. No overusing caps, in any kind.
3. No rude.
4. Good issues/pull requests.
